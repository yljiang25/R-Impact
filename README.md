## Introduction

### R-Impact is an iOS app I created with 3 teammates for the Everyone Can Code iOS App Development Program. The idea for the app started with my interest in building an app focused on recycling clothing and promoting eco-friendly alternatives to simply discarding clothing as a way to combat the overconsumption of fast-fashion. Our app was voted top four amongst 20+ teams throughout Chicago allowing us to showcase the app at the Apple Store in Chicago with the mayor in attendance.
